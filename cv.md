## About me

When I was at university, I was interested in website development. I studied HTML/CSS, but JS i wasn't learn it, as it seemed to me very difficult and incomprehensible.

While studying at the university, I found company that was developing websites, and they were hiring me, but I had the position of an account manager. without knowledge of JS, I was not hired for the position of a junior front-end developer. After working there for some time, I quit and got a job in the same position, but in a smaller company.

In 2016-2017, I set myself the goal of learning English and flying to the USA by the program Work and Travel.

In the summer of 2017, I successfully flew to the USA, returned to Russia in the fall, got a job as a project manager in a company that developed landingpage for WordPress.

I was work there for 1 year, I decided that I wanted to try to create something of my own. I found a partner and we were start developing sites by WordPress. But it was more like a constructor than a development.

At the moment, my partner and I have stopped working, I was left without work and made a decision for myself that I would become a front-end developer and do some cool projects on my own, especially since I have these ideas in my head.
